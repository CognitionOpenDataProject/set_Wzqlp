For this article you should focus on the findings of Experiment 1 reported in section 2.1.3. and section 2.2. Specifically, you should attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below and associated tables/figures:

> 2.1.3. Coding and analysis

> Infants’ looking time served as our dependent measure. Infants’ left-right eye gaze directions were coded frame-by-frame by trained coders, blind to the hypotheses.4 For the Familiarization Phase, we coded infants’ looking time for each individual trial. We then calculated their mean looking time across all 8 familiarization trials, as well as their mean looking time for familiarization trials 1–4 and 5–8 (see Table 1). For the Test Phase, we coded infants’ first 10 s of looking to the test images,5 and then calculated a Preference Score (looking time to novel test image/looking time to both test images combined) (see Table 1). A preliminary analysis revealed that infants’ Preference Scores at test were not related to their gender, age, or looking time during familiarization. In addition, there was no change in infants’ looking over the first and last 4 familiarization trials, t(13) = 1.31, p = 0.213 (see Table 1).

> 2.2. Results

> This exposure manipulation had a dramatic effect: Infants revealed a robust preference for the novel test image, M = 0.57, SD = 0.09; t(13) = 3.12, p = 0.008, d = 0.78, indicating that they successfully formed an object category (Fig. 2). Their success stands in sharp contrast to infants’ failure with no such exposure, at an age after which they had tuned out lemur vocalizations (Ferry et al., 2013). Thus, mere exposure to lemur vocalizations, even briefly, is sufficient to permit infants to reinstate a developmentally prior link between this signal and object categorization.
